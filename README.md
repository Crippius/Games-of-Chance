# Games of Chance
Games of Chance is a project in which I tried to create different casino games with Python; I later looked at some interesting data about gambling with the same programs by using plots and general statistics.

## What can you find?
In this repository you can find the python script that simulates the following games:
- Heads or Tails
- Slot Machine
- Roulette
- Blackjack
- Baccarat

In the games folder you can find the script for each game separately.

In the notebook file you will find my study on gambling while using these pieces of software.
## Contributing
Since I wanted to complete this project individually, I will only accept small, quality of life changes for this project, not entire new games.

## What's next?
Working on making the code interactable in the main.py file

Studying how tkinter works to play the game in an appropiate environment and not on the terminal
